# concert-list
A list to keep track of concerts.
This app is intended to be used by concert-goers to keep track of the concerts they've been to and plan to go to.
You can add the name of the artist you are going to see and the date you will see them. 
After the concert, you can rate it out of five stars by clicking the button next to the concert.
If you want, there is the option to click on the concert to slash it out to show that you've already gone.
